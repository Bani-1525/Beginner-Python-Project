# 🎯 Python Guessing Game

Welcome to my mini Python project: **Guess the Number**!  
This simple CLI (command-line interface) game is built using basic Python features like loops, conditionals, random numbers, and string handling.

---

## 📌 Game Description

- The computer randomly picks a number between **1 and 100**
- You have to **guess the number**
- After each guess, you get a hint:
  - 🔼 "Guess too Small"
  - 🔽 "Guess too Big"
- You can also **type "Quit"** anytime to exit the game.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `while True` loop
- `input()` and `if/elif/else` statements
- `random.randint()`
- String handling with `.lower().strip()`
- Graceful exit using `break`
